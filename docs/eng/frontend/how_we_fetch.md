This JavaScript function, named `edit`, manages the display of expense elements on a web page based on a unique identifier called `expense_id`. Here's how it works:

- When the function is called with an `expense_id`, it checks the type attribute of the second element with the class name matching the `expense_id`. If it's set to "hidden," it assumes the corresponding expense element is currently hidden and needs to be displayed.

- If the element is hidden, the function changes various CSS properties of the expense elements to make them visible. It sets the display property of the first element with the class name matching the `expense_id` to "flex", meaning it will be displayed as a flexible container.

- It also removes the "hidden" type attribute from the second and third elements with the class name matching the `expense_id`, making them visible.

- Additionally, it adjusts the display properties of other related elements to control their visibility accordingly.

- If the element is already visible, the function reverses the process by hiding the elements and adjusting their properties to restore their initial state.

Overall, this function provides a mechanism for toggling the visibility of expense elements on a webpage based on their unique identifier, enhancing user interaction and interface responsiveness.

Remember to ensure proper error handling and validation when implementing functions like this in a real-world application to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
