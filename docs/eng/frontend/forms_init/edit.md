This Python code defines a Flask web application form using the Flask-WTF extension, which simplifies form handling and validation in Flask applications.

Here's how it works:

1. **Imports**: The code imports necessary modules from Flask-WTF and WTForms libraries. These modules are used for form creation, field types, and validation.

2. **Form Definition**: The `EditForm` class is defined, which represents a form for editing an expense entry. This form inherits from `FlaskForm`, indicating that it's a Flask form.

3. **Field Definition**: Inside the `EditForm` class, various fields are defined:

   - `editNombre`: A StringField for editing the name of the expense entry. It's required (`DataRequired()` validator) to ensure it's not empty.
   - `editMonto`: A FloatField for editing the amount of the expense entry. It's initialized with a default value of "10" and is also required (`DataRequired()` validator).
   - `editExpenseId`: A StringField for storing the ID of the expense entry to be edited. It's left empty, without any validators.
   - `submit`: A SubmitField with the label "Guardar" (Save in Spanish). This field represents a submit button for the form.

4. **Documentation**: The class is documented using docstrings. Each parameter and the purpose of the class are explained briefly. For example:
   - `editNombre`: The parameter representing the name of the expense entry. It's validated to be non-empty.
   - `editMonto`: The parameter representing the amount of the expense entry. It's validated to be non-empty.
   - `editExpenseId`: The parameter representing the ID of the expense entry.

This form can be integrated into a Flask application to allow users to edit expense entries, ensuring that the entered data meets certain validation criteria.
