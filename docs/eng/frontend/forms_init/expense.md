This code defines a basic form using Flask-WTF and WTForms libraries in Python for adding an expense entry.

1. Import necessary modules:

   - `FlaskForm` from `flask_wtf`
   - `FloatField`, `StringField`, and `SubmitField` from `wtforms`
   - `DataRequired` validator from `wtforms.validators`

2. Define a class named `BasicForm` that inherits from `FlaskForm`. This class represents the form for adding an expense entry.

3. Inside the class, define three fields:

   - `nombre`: StringField representing the name of the expense entry. It is required and validated to be non-empty.
   - `monto`: FloatField representing the amount of the expense entry. It is required and validated to be non-empty.
   - `submit`: SubmitField representing the submit button with the label "Add Expense".

4. Add docstrings to the class and its attributes for documentation purposes. The docstrings provide information about the purpose of the class and the parameters.

Here's a brief explanation of the docstrings:

- The docstring for the `BasicForm` class explains that it defines a basic form for adding an expense entry.
- For each attribute (`nombre` and `monto`), the docstring explains the purpose of the parameter and its validation requirements.

This form can be used in a Flask application to create a web form for users to input the name and amount of an expense they want to add. The form ensures that both the name and amount fields are filled out before allowing submission.
