2. **Imports and Definitions**:

   - The `time` module is imported to work with timestamps.
   - The `traceback` module is imported for exception handling.
   - A placeholder logger is imported from the `logger` module.
   - Two placeholder lambdas `__s` and `__e` are defined to represent start and end timestamps.

3. **Function Definitions**:

   - `__handle_end_timer`: This internal function calculates the duration of execution for a given function and logs it. It takes the start timestamp and the function as input parameters.
   - `timer`: This is the main function exposed by the module. It takes a function `func` as its first argument along with any additional positional or keyword arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`). It measures the execution time of `func`, logs the duration, and handles any unhandled exceptions.

4. **Execution Flow**:
   - When the `timer` function is called, it records the start time.
   - It executes the provided function `func` with the given arguments.
   - If an exception occurs during execution, it logs the error, calculates the execution time, and re-raises the exception.
   - Otherwise, it logs the execution time and returns the result of the function execution.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to measure the execution time of functions and handle exceptions that may occur during their execution.
